# Double-Inverted-Pendulum-MATLAB
Designing controller for double inverted pendulum in MATLAB
The dynamic system investigated for this project is the Double Inverted Pendulum. In the first step, the dynamic equations of the system, which are non-linear, have been extracted and stability analysis has been done for it.
In the next step, the nonlinear model is linearized around its equilibrium point , and then, assuming known values for the state variables of this system, by extracting the required transfer functions, various types of linear controllers are implemented on it and the results have been analyzed.
In the last step, assuming the unavailability of some variables of the system state, a reduced order observer designed and its response based on certain initial conditions investigated.
